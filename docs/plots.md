# Plots

There are currently 5 plot blocks available:

* BarChartBlock ([Bar and line plots](bar_and_line.md))
* ContourPlotBlock ([Contour plot](contour.md))
* LinePlotBlock ([Bar and line plots](bar_and_line.md))
* PieChartBlock ([Pie chart](pie.md))
* ScatterPlotBlock ([Scatter plot](scatter.md))

Each plot block has a number of fields appropriate to its type. All of the blocks have a `Plot data` field. This is based on the `wagtail.contrib.table_block`.
